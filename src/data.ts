export const ABOUT = `Resume? Nah . I am a licensed button-pusher (authorized chaos) who builds tiny fortresses only to siege them later — think polite arson with PR attached. Languages sneak past you as PY/TS/GO; frameworks masquerade as "an echo in the canyon", "a gowned DJ", and "what comes next". When not cataloguing poorly configured services I collect travel stamps and awkward social-engineering anecdotes (free cringe with every convo). Keyboard layout: 60% WASD, primary hobby: making managers say “why wasn’t this found earlier?” — I roast insecure configs for sport and leave polite bug reports like anonymous valentines.`;
